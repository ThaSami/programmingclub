# programmingclub
University of Jordan programming club

This is a website similar to codeforce 
it was made to help students from my University to learn coding. 
students can solve programming problems and write there code in 10+ programming languages.

used:
open source API ( compile box ) , nodejs + docker to provide isolation when compiling the code.
python flask + sqllite for the backend.
